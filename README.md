# PhysicsCellularAutomaton
Currently this cellular automaton is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life for testing purposes, it will become more of a physics simulation in the future now that the base infrastructure is done

## How to use:
### Setup:
Currently the program is setup to spawn a bunch of random noise for testing purposes, but you can also use the left mouse button to draw pixels to the screen
### Controls:
**LMB:** Spawn in new cells at the cursor\n
**Enter:** Run the simulation at 60 simulation steps per second\n
**Right Arrow:** Step the simulation one frame per press\n
